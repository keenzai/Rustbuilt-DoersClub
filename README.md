The rustbuilt forge
==============

We are Rustbuilt.

We created modern society by forging American innovation.
It should not be forgotten by anyoneâ€”including ourselves.

RustBuilt as an organization has come to exist organically to this point. To see the charter click here

We are working on more formal details about Rustbuilt's goals, mission, values and ways to participate. 

As that is occurring, here is one way to participate. 

The forge is a place we have created for ourselves to further the training and support we wil need.

The core elements will include resources, drills, mentorship, and support. 

Please join us in this experiment, feel free to edit/change/suggest.

Thanks and welcome.
